**CUDA Kernels Playground**

This repository is a personal learning and experimentation space dedicated to mastering CUDA programming in C++, with a long-term goal of applying GPU kernel optimization techniques to deep learning systems.

It is not a finished library, but a growing playground where I explore:

* GPU memory models

* Parallel computation patterns

* Kernel performance optimization

* Numerical stability on GPUs

* Low-level building blocks used inside deep learning frameworks

Ultimately, this repository will serve as a foundation for:

Custom CUDA kernels, optimized operators, and PyTorch extensions.
